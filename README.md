**A Unity Adventure Game Project**

## 📖 The Story  

On a night when silence weighed heavy over the library, three curious students found themselves drawn to a forbidden tome hidden deep among the dust-laden shelves. Bound in cracked leather and etched with symbols that seemed to shift when gazed upon, the book pulsed faintly, as though alive.  

Against reason but driven by youthful daring, they opened it—and the words stirred, rising like smoke, swallowing their world in a single breath.  

When their senses returned, they stood not in their familiar halls but in **Acclia**, a realm stitched from dreams and nightmares alike.  

🌌 Rivers of crystal light carved through valleys.  
🌳 Forests shimmered with leaves that whispered forgotten songs.  
🏰 Towers of sun-gilded stone reached into a sky where stars danced in strange constellations.  

At first, it seemed paradise. Yet the longer they lingered, the more they saw the cracks beneath the splendor:  

- Shadows moving where no sun touched.  
- Distant horns thundering across the plains.  
- Whispers carried by the wind of creatures that did not belong to light.  

⚔️ Goblins crept through the forests like snarled roots.  
🔥 Orc warbands marched with fire in their fists.  
🕯️ And above all, a **warlock’s unseen hand** stretched across the kingdom, spreading corruption like a slow rot.  

Lost, frightened, yet bound together by necessity, the students realized the truth—**Acclia teetered on the edge of ruin**, and the book had not merely brought them here… it had **chosen them**.  

To survive, to return, they must master its hidden spark, rise against the encroaching dark, and become the **unexpected saviors of a world not their own**.
