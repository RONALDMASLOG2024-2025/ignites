# 🔥 IGNITES  
_A 2D Top-Down Adventure built in Unity_

---

## 🌙 Story

You are a UIC student studying late in the campus library. While reading an old, leather-bound book, the words ignite and pull you inside.  

The library transforms into the **Tomeworld**:  
- towering stacks become endless forests  
- reading tables shift into vast plazas  
- mischievous goblins — manifestations of forgotten footnotes — roam the halls  

To escape, you must:  
- Navigate through increasingly strange book sections  
- Defeat rival **goblin factions**  
- Recover the torn **Pages of Passage**  
- Sew the book back together to return home  

Along the way, you’ll rescue fellow students who can be unlocked as **alternate classes**:  
- ⚔️ Warrior — strong melee fighter  
- 🏹 Archer — precise ranged attacks  
- 🪓 Lancer — versatile reach and mobility  

Each rescued student becomes **a playable character with distinct playstyles**, letting you replay the adventure in new ways.
